TOM!	Polly
What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!	Polly
Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--	Polly
I never did see the beat of that boy!	Polly
Y-o-u-u TOM!	Polly
There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in there?	Polly Nothing.	Tom Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth.	Polly What _is_ that truck?	Polly
I don't know, aunt.	Tom
Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.	Polly My! Look behind you, aunt!	Tom Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, and I'll just be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and I've _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or I'll be the ruination of the child.	Polly Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?	Polly Yes'm.	Tom Powerful warm, warn't it?	Polly Yes'm.	Tom Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?	Polly No'm--well, not very much.	Tom But you ain't too warm now, though.	Polly Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?	Tom Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you?	Polly Unbutton your jacket!	Polly
Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. _This_ time.	Polly
Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it's black.	Sidney
Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!	Polly
Siddy, I'll lick you for that.	Tom
She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!	Tom
I can lick you!	Tom
I'd like to see you try it.	Newbie
Well, I can do it.	Tom
No you can't, either.	Newbie
Yes I can.	Tom
No you can't.	Newbie
I can.	Tom
You can't.	Newbie
Can!	Tom
Can't!	Newbie
What's your name?	Tom
'Tisn't any of your business, maybe.	Newbie
Well I 'low I'll _make_ it my business.	Tom
Well why don't you?	Newbie
If you say much, I will.	Tom
Much--much--_much_. There now.	Newbie
Oh, you think you're mighty smart, _don't_ you? I could lick you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.	Tom
Well why don't you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.	Newbie
Well I _will_, if you fool with me.	Tom
Oh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix.	Newbie
Smarty! You think you're _some_, now, _don't_ you? Oh, what a hat!	Tom
You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it off--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.	Newbie
You're a liar!	Tom
You're another.	Newbie
You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.	Tom
Aw--take a walk!	Newbie
Say--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock off'n your head.	Tom
Oh, of _course_ you will.	Newbie
Well I _will_.	Tom
Well why don't you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will for? Why don't you _do_ it? It's because you're afraid.	Newbie
I _ain't_ afraid.	Tom
You are.	Newbie
I ain't.	Tom
You are.	Newbie
Get away from here!	Tom
Go away yourself!	Newbie
I won't.	Tom
I won't either.	Newbie
You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too.	Tom
What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger than he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too.	Newbie
That's a lie.	Tom
_Your_ saying so don't make it so.	Newbie
I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.	Tom
Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.	Newbie
Don't you crowd me now; you better look out.	Tom
Well, you _said_ you'd do it--why don't you do it?	Newbie
By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.	Tom
Holler 'nuff!	Tom
Holler 'nuff!	Tom
Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next time.	Tom
Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.	Tom
Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own business--she 'lowed _she'd_ 'tend to de whitewashin'.	Jim
Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always talks. Gimme the bucket--I won't be gone only a a minute. _She_ won't ever know.	Tom
Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me. 'Deed she would.	Jim
_She_! She never licks anybody--whacks 'em over the head with her thimble--and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful, but talk don't hurt--anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a marvel. I'll give you a white alley!	Tom
White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw.	Tom
My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful 'fraid ole missis--	Jim
And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe.	Tom
Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!	BenRogers
Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!	BenRogers
Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!	BenRogers
Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling!	BenRogers Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now! Come--out with your spring-line--what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now--let her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T!	BenRogers
_Hi-Yi! You're_ up a stump, ain't you!	BenRogers
Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?	BenRogers
Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.	Tom
Say--I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd druther _work_--wouldn't you? Course you would!	BenRogers
What do you call work?	Tom
Why, ain't _that_ work?	BenRogers
Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.	Tom
Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you _like_ it?	BenRogers
Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?	Tom
Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.	BenRogers
No--no--I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and _she_ wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it's got to be done.	Tom
No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. Only just a little--I'd let _you_, if you was me, Tom.	Ben
Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it--	Tom
Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I'll give you the core of my apple.	BenRogers
Well, here--No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard--	Tom
I'll give you _all_ of it!	BenRogers
Mayn't I go and play now, aunt?	Tom
What, a'ready? How much have you done?	Polly
It's all done, aunt.	Tom
Tom, don't lie to me--I can't bear it.	Polly
I ain't, aunt; it _is_ all done.	Tom
Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when you're a mind to, Tom."" And then she diluted the compliment by adding, ""But it's powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I'll tan you.	Polly
Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it.	Tom
Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into that sugar if I warn't watching you.	Polly
Hold on, now, what 'er you belting _me_ for?--Sid broke it!	Tom
Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough.	Polly
Blessed are the--a--a--	Tom
Poor--	Mary
Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--	Tom
In spirit--	Mary
In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--	Tom
_Theirs_--	Mary
For _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--	Tom
Sh--	Mary
For they--a--	Tom
S, H, A--	Mary
For they S, H--Oh, I don't know what it is!	Tom
_Shall_!	Mary
Oh, _shall_! for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--blessed are they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for they shall--a--shall _what_? Why don't you tell me, Mary?--what do you want to be so mean for?	Tom
Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I wouldn't do that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, Tom, you'll manage it--and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice. There, now, that's a good boy.	Mary
All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.	Tom
Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is nice.	Mary
You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it again.	Tom
Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt you.	Mary
Please, Tom--that's a good boy.	Mary
Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?	Tom
Yes.	Billy
What'll you take for her?	Tom
What'll you give?	Billy
Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.	Tom
Less see 'em.	Billy
Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There--that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.	MrWalters
Oh, no, not Tom--it is--	JudgeThatcher
Thomas.	Tom
Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's very well. But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't you?	JudgeThatcher
Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas and say sir. You mustn't forget your manners.	MrWalters
Thomas Sawyer--sir.	Tom
That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two thousand verses is a great many--very, very great many. And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world; it's what makes great men and good men; you'll be a great man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you'll look back and say, It's all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it's all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn--it's all owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have it all for my own, always--it's all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will say, Thomas--and you wouldn't take any money for those two thousand verses--no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind telling me and this lady some of the things you've learned--no, I know you wouldn't--for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won't you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?	JudgeThatcher
Answer the gentleman, Thomas--don't be afraid.	MrWalters
Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter, Tom?	Sidney
Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me.	Tom
Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.	Sidney
No--never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.	Tom
But I must! _Don't_ groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this way?	Sidney
Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me.	Tom
Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don't!_ It makes my flesh crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?	Sidney
I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to me. When I'm gone--	Tom
Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom--oh, don't. Maybe--	Sidney
I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to town, and tell her--	Tom
Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!	Sidney
Dying!	Polly
Yes'm. Don't wait--come quick!	Sidney
Rubbage! I don't believe it!	Polly
You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?	Polly
Oh, auntie, I'm--	Tom
What's the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?	Polly
Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!	Tom
Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this.	Polly
Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all.	Tom
Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?	Polly
One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful.	Tom
There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Well--your tooth _is_ loose, but you're not going to die about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.	Polly
Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay home from school.	Tom
Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.	Polly
Hello, Huckleberry!	Tom
Hello yourself, and see how you like it.	Huck
What's that you got?	Tom
Dead cat.	Huck
Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him?	Tom
Bought him off'n a boy.	Huck
What did you give?	Tom
I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.	Huck
Where'd you get the blue ticket?	Tom
Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.	Huck
Say--what is dead cats good for, Huck?	Tom
Good for? Cure warts with.	Huck
No! Is that so? I know something that's better.	Tom
I bet you don't. What is it?	Huck
Why, spunk-water.	Tom
Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water.	Huck
You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?	Tom
No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did.	Huck
Who told you so!	Tom
Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!	Huck
Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don't know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn't_ lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.	Tom
Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.	Huck
In the daytime?	Tom
Certainly.	Huck
With his face to the stump?	Tom
Yes. Least I reckon so.	Huck
Did he say anything?	Tom
I don't reckon he did. I don't know.	Huck
Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say: and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted.	Tom
Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner done.	Huck
No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean.	Tom
Yes, bean's good. I've done that.	Huck
Have you? What's your way?	Tom
You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes.	Huck
Yes, that's it, Huck--that's it; though when you're burying it if you say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better. That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say--how do you cure 'em with dead cats?	Tom
Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard 'long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!' That'll fetch _any_ wart.	Huck
Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?	Tom
No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.	Huck
Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch.	Tom
Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.	Huck
Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?	Tom
Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backards.	Huck
Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?	Tom
To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.	Huck
But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?	Tom
Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?--and _then_ it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't reckon.	Huck
I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?	Tom
Of course--if you ain't afeard.	Huck
Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?	Tom
Yes--and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window--but don't you tell.	Huck
I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I'll meow this time. Say--what's that?	Tom
Nothing but a tick.	Huck
Where'd you get him?	Tom
Out in the woods.	Huck
What'll you take for him?	Tom
I don't know. I don't want to sell him.	Huck
All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway.	Tom
Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm satisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me.	Huck
Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted to.	Tom
Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year.	Huck
Say, Huck--I'll give you my tooth for him.	Tom
Less see it.	Huck
Is it genuwyne? Huck Well, all right, it's a trade.	Huck Thomas Sawyer!	Schoolmaster Sir!	Tom Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?	Schoolmaster Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.	Tom Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your jacket.	Schoolmaster
Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.	Schoolmaster
Let me see it.	Becky
It's nice--make a man.	Becky
It's a beautiful man--now make me coming along.	Becky
It's ever so nice--I wish I could draw. Becky It's easy, I'll learn you.	Tom Oh, will you? When?	Becky At noon. Do you go home to dinner?	Tom I'll stay if you will.	Becky Good--that's a whack. What's your name?	Tom Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer.	Becky That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me Tom, will you?	Tom
Yes.	Becky
Oh, it ain't anything.	Tom
Yes it is.	Becky
No it ain't. You don't want to see.	Tom
Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.	Becky
You'll tell.	Tom
No I won't--deed and deed and double deed won't.	Becky
You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?	Tom
No, I won't ever tell _any_body. Now let me.	Becky
Oh, _you_ don't want to see!	Tom
Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.	Becky
Oh, you bad thing!	Tom
Now as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side, you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.	Tom
All right, go ahead; start him up.	JoeHarper
Tom, you let him alone.	JoeHarper
I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.	Tom
No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone.	JoeHarper
Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much.	Tom
Let him alone, I tell you.	JoeHarper
I won't!	Tom
You shall--he's on my side of the line.	JoeHarper
Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?	Tom
I don't care whose tick he is--he's on my side of the line, and you sha'n't touch him.	JoeHarper
Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I blame please with him, or die!	Tom
Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same way.	Tom
Do you love rats?	Tom
No! I hate them!	Becky
Well, I do, too--_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your head with a string.	Tom
No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.	Becky
Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.	Tom
Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it back to me.	Becky
Was you ever at a circus?	Tom
Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good.	Becky
I been to the circus three or four times--lots of times. Church ain't shucks to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time. I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.	Tom
Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up.	Becky
Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money--most a dollar a day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?	Tom
What's that?	Becky
Why, engaged to be married.	Tom
No.	Becky
Would you like to?	Tom
I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?	Becky
Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's all. Anybody can do it.	Tom
Kiss? What do you kiss for?	Becky
Why, that, you know, is to--well, they always do that.	Tom
Everybody?	Becky
Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember what I wrote on the slate?	Tom
Ye--yes.	Becky
What was it?	Tom
I sha'n't tell you.	Becky
Shall I tell _you_?	Tom
Ye--yes--but some other time.	Becky
No, now.	Tom
No, not now--to-morrow.	Becky
Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky--I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so easy.	Tom
Now you whisper it to me--just the same.	Tom
You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you mustn't ever tell anybody--_will_ you, Tom? Now you won't, _will_ you?	Becky
No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky.	Tom
Now, Becky, it's all done--all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid of that--it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky.	Tom
Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?	Tom
No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody but you--and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.	Becky
Certainly. Of course. That's _part_ of it. And always coming to school or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't anybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that's the way you do when you're engaged.	Tom
It's so nice. I never heard of it before.	Becky
Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence--	Tom
Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!	Becky
Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.	Tom
Yes, you do, Tom--you know you do.	Becky
Becky, I--I don't care for anybody but you.	Tom
Becky, won't you say something?	Tom
Please, Becky, won't you take it?	Tom
Tom! Come back, Tom!	Becky
What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!	Tom
Well, that beats anything!	Tom
Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!	Tom
He dasn't tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.	Tom
Brother, go find your brother!	Tom
Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.	Tom
Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?	Tom
Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that--that--	JoeHarper
I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of it.	JoeHarper
Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the book. You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back.	Tom
Now, you got to let me kill _you_. That's fair.	JoeHarper
Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.	Tom
Well, it's blamed mean--that's all.	JoeHarper
Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.	Tom
Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?	Tom I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, _ain't_ it?	Huck I bet it is.	Tom Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?	Tom O' course he does. Least his sperrit does.	Huck I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls him Hoss.	Tom
A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead people, Tom.	Huck
What is it, Tom?	Huck
Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?	Tom
I--	Huck
There! Now you hear it.	Tom
Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?	Huck
I dono. Think they'll see us?	Tom
Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't come.	Huck
Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at all.	Tom
I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.	Huck
Listen!	Tom
Look! See there! What is it?	Tom
It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.	Huck
It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners! Can you pray?	Huck
I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I lay me down to sleep, I--'	Tom
Sh!	Huck
What is it, Huck?	Tom
They're _humans_! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's voice.	Huck
No--'tain't so, is it?	Tom
I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!	Huck
All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's Injun Joe.	Tom
That's so--that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a dern sight. What kin they be up to?	Huck
Hurry, men! the moon might come out at any moment.	DrRobinson
Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with another five, or here she stays.	Potter
That's the talk!	InjunJoe
Look here, what does this mean?	DrRobinson
You required your pay in advance, and I've paid you.	DrRobinson
Yes, and you done more than that. Five years ago you drove me away from your father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for nothing. And now I've _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!	InjunJoe
Here, now, don't you hit my pard!	Potter
_That_ score is settled--damn you.	InjunJoe
Lord, how is this, Joe?	Potter
It's a dirty business. What did you do it for?	InjunJoe
I! I never done it!	Potter
Look here! That kind of talk won't wash.	InjunJoe
I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's	 in my head yet--worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle;	 can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe--_honest_, now,	 old feller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--'pon my soul and honor, I	 never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful--and him so	 young and promising.	Potter
Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched you another awful clip--and here you've laid, as dead as a wedge til now.	InjunJoe
Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but never with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell! Say you won't tell, Joe--that's a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don't you remember? You _won't_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?	Potter
No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say.	InjunJoe
Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I live.	Potter
Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering. You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any tracks behind you.	InjunJoe
If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself--chicken-heart!	InjunJoe
If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!	Tom
I can't stand it much longer.	Tom
Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?	Tom
If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it.	Huck
Do you though?	Tom
Why, I _know_ it, Tom.	Huck
Who'll tell? We?	Tom
What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe _didn't_ hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as we're a laying here.	Huck
That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.	Tom
If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's generally drunk enough.	Huck
Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?	Tom
What's the reason he don't know it?	Huck
Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?	Tom
By hokey, that's so, Tom!	Huck
And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!	Tom
No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and besides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldn't phase him. He says so, his own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.	Huck
Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?	Tom
Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak 'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep mum.	Huck
I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear that we--	Tom
Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little rubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing 'bout a big thing like this. And blood.	Huck
Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on it.	Tom
What's verdigrease?	Huck
It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once--you'll see.	Tom
Tom does this keep us from _ever_ telling--_always_?	Huck
Of course it does. It don't make any difference _what_ happens, we got to keep mum. We'd drop down dead--don't _you_ know that?	Tom
Yes, I reckon that's so.	Huck
Which of us does he mean?	Huck
I dono--peep through the crack. Quick!	Tom
No, _you_, Tom!	Huck
I can't--I can't _do_ it, Huck!	Tom
Please, Tom. There 'tis again!	Huck
Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!	Tom
I know his voice. It's Bull Harbison.	Tom
Oh, that's good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet anything it was a _stray_ dog.	Huck
Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!	Huck
Oh, Huck, _its a stray dog_!	Tom
Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?	Huck
Huck, he must mean us both--we're right together.	Tom
Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout where _I'll_ go to. I been so wicked.	Huck
Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller's told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried--but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay I'll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!	Tom
_You_ bad!	Huck
Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am. Oh, _lordy_, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.	Huck
Look, Hucky, look! He's got his _back_ to us!	Tom
Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?	Huck
Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you know. _Now_ who can he mean?	Tom
Sh! What's that?	Tom
Sounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it's somebody snoring, Tom.	Huck
That _is_ it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?	Tom
I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more.	Huck
Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?	Tom
I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!	Huck
Oh, geeminy, it's _him_!	HuckTom
Say, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there ain't anybody dead there yet.	Huck
Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?	Tom
Yes, but she ain't _dead_. And what's more, she's getting better, too.	Huck
All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about these kind of things, Huck.	Tom
I didn't do it, friends, 'pon my word and honor I never done it.	Potter
Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never--	Potter
Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time.	Sidney
Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get-- Tell 'em, Joe, tell 'em--it ain't any use any more.	Potter
I couldn't help it--I couldn't help it. I wanted to run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here.	Potter
It's a bad sign. What you got on your mind, Tom?	Polly
Nothing. Nothing 't I know of.	Tom
And you do talk such stuff. You said that over and over. Tell _what_? What is it you'll tell?	Sidney
Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it.	Polly
Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter.	Tom
You better make sure.	Tom
Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame anybody but your own self.	Tom
Tom, what on earth ails that cat?	Polly
I don't know, aunt.	Tom
Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?	Polly
Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a good time.	Tom
They do, do they?	Polly
Yes'm. That is, I believe they do.	Tom
You _do_?	Polly
Yes'm.	Tom
Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?	Polly
I done it out of pity for him--because he hadn't any aunt.	Tom
Hadn't any aunt!--you numskull. What has that got to do with it?	Polly
Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a human!	Tom
I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.	Polly
I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It done _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since--	Tom
Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any more medicine.	Polly
Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.	Tom
'Tis well. Give the countersign.	Tom
Luff, and bring her to the wind!	Tom
Aye-aye, sir!	JoeHuck
Steady, steady-y-y-y!	Tom
Steady it is, sir!	JoeHuck
Let her go off a point!	Tom
Point it is, sir!	JoeHuck
What sail's she carrying?	Tom
Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir.	JoeHuck
Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye--foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!	Tom
Aye-aye, sir!	JoeHuck
Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!	Tom
Aye-aye, sir!	JoeHuck
Hellum-a-lee--hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port, port! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!	Tom
Steady it is, sir!	JoeHuck
_Ain't_ it gay?	JoeHarper
It's _nuts_!	Tom
What would the boys say if they could see us?	Tom
Say? Well, they'd just die to be here--hey, Hucky!	JoeHarper
I reckon so, anyways, I'm suited. I don't want nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally--and here they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.	Huck
It's just the life for me. You don't have to get up, mornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that blame foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do _anything_, Joe, when he's ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and then he don't have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.	Tom
Oh yes, that's so, but I hadn't thought much about it, you know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it.	JoeHarper
You see, people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And a hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--	Tom
What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?	Huck
I dono. But they've _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do that if you was a hermit.	Tom
Dern'd if I would	Huck
Well, what would you do?	Tom
I dono. But I wouldn't do that.	Huck
Why, Huck, you'd _have_ to. How'd you get around it?	Tom
Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away.	Huck
Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be a disgrace.	Tom
What does pirates have to do?	Huck
Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make 'em walk a plank.	Tom
And they carry the women to the island, they don't kill the women.	JoeHarper
No, they don't kill the women--they're too noble. And the women's always beautiful, too.	Tom 
And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver and di'monds.	JoeHarper
Who?	Huck
Why, the pirates.	JoeHarper
I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate, but I ain't got none but these.	Huck
What is it!	JoeHarper
I wonder	Tom
'Tain't thunder, becuz thunder--	Huck Hark!	Tom Listen--don't talk.	Tom Let's go and see.	Tom I know now!	Tom That's it!	Huck they done that last summer, when Bill Turner got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's anybody that's drownded, they'll float right there and stop.	Huck
Yes, I've heard about that. I wonder what makes the bread do that.	JoeHarper
Oh, it ain't the bread, so much, I reckon it's mostly what they _say_ over it before they start it out.	Tom
But they don't say anything over it. I've seen 'em and they don't.	Huck
Well, that's funny. But maybe they say it to themselves. Of _course_ they do. Anybody might know that.	Tom
By jings, I wish I was over there, now,	JoeHarper
I do too. I'd give heaps to know who it is.	Huck
Boys, I know who's drownded--it's us!	Tom
What makes the candle blow so?	Polly
Why, that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid.	Polly
But as I was saying, he warn't _bad_, so to say--only misch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was.	Polly It was just so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never, never, poor abused boy!	MrsHarper
I hope Tom's better off where he is, but if he'd been better in some ways--	Sidney
Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll take care of _him_--never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't know how to give him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was such a comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most.	Polly
The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be the name of the Lord! But it's so hard--Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling. Little did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug him and bless him for it.	MrsHarper
Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now. And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--	Polly
No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that sort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?	JoeHarper
Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?	Huck
Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't back here to breakfast.	JoeHarper
Which he is!	Tom
I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore it again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?	Tom
Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome.	JoeHarper
Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by.	Tom
Just think of the fishing that's here.	Tom
I don't care for fishing. I want to go home.	JoeHarper
But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere.	Tom
Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home.	JoeHarper
Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.	Tom
Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one. I ain't any more baby than you are.	JoeHarper
Well, we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck? Poor thing--does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here, don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?	Tom
Y-e-s	Huck
I'll never speak to you again as long as I live. There now!	JoeHarper
Who cares!	Tom
Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't crybabies. We'll stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per'aps.	Tom
I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom.	Huck
I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.	Tom
Tom, I better go.	Huck
Well, go 'long--who's hendering you.	Tom
Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for you when we get to shore.	Huck
Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all.	Tom
Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!	Tom
Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt long ago.	Tom
So would I. It's just nothing.	JoeHarper
Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could,	Tom
That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk just	Tom
that way--haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't.	Tom Yes--heaps of times	Huck Well, I have too, oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember, Huck, 'bout me saying that?	Tom
Yes, that's so. That was the day after I lost a white alley. No, 'twas the day before.	Huck
There--I told you so, Huck recollects it.	Tom
I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day. I don't feel sick.	JoeHarper
Neither do I. I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff Thatcher couldn't.	Tom
Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him try it once. _He'd_ see!	JoeHarper
I bet he would. And Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it once.	Tom
Oh, don't I!	JoeHarper
Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.	JoeHarper
'Deed it would, Joe. Say--I wish the boys could see us now.	Tom
So do I.	JoeHarper
Say--boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.' And you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll say, 'Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain't very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all right, if it's _strong_ enough.' And then you'll out with the pipes, and we'll light up just as ca'm, and then just see 'em look!	Tom
By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!	JoeHarper
So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating, won't they wish they'd been along?	Tom
Oh, I reckon not! I'll just _bet_ they will!	JoeHarper
I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.	JoeHarper
I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring. No, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it.	Tom
Quick! boys, go for the tent!	Tom
Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got anything now to remember him by.	Becky
It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say that--I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll never, never, never see him any more.	Becky
Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck.	Tom
And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!	Polly
Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off.	Polly
Yes, you could have done that, Tom, and I believe you would if you had thought of it.	Mary
Would you, Tom?	Polly
Say, now, would you, if you'd thought of it?	Polly
I--well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.	Tom
Tom, I hoped you loved me that much. It would have been something if you'd cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn't _do_ it.	Polly
Now, auntie, that ain't any harm, it's only Tom's giddy way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.	Mary
More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and _done_ it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little.	Polly
Now, auntie, you know I do care for you	Tom
I'd know it better if you acted more like it.	Polly
I wish now I'd thought, but I dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?	Tom
It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing. What did you dream?	Polly
Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.	Tom
Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us.	Polly
And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.	Tom
Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?	Polly
Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now.	Tom
Well, try to recollect--can't you?	Polly
Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--	Tom
Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!	Polly
I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!	Tom
Mercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!	Polly
And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'	Tom
Go _on_, Tom!	Polly
Just let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you believed the door was open.	Tom
As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!	Polly
And then--and then--well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if you made Sid go and--and--	Tom
Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?	Polly
You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.	Tom
Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my days! Don't tell _me_ there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her get around _this_ with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!	Polly
Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn't _bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.	Tom
And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!	Polly
And then you began to cry.	Tom
So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither.	AuntPolly
Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and	Tom
she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it	Tom
out her own self--	Tom
Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that's what you was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!	Polly
I don't think I said anything	Sidney
Yes you did, Sid. Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?	Mary
He said--I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to, but if I'd been better sometimes--	Tom
_There_, d'you hear that! It was his very words!	Polly
And you shut him up sharp.	Tom
I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There _was_ an angel there, somewheres!	Polly
And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer--	Tom
Just as true as I live!	Polly
And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went.	Tom
It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a' seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!	Polly
Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips.	Tom
Did you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that!	Polly
It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream	Sidney
Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if you was ever found again--now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've hendered me long enough.	Polly
Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?	Becky
I did come--didn't you see me?	MaryAustin
Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?	Becky
I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw _you_.	MaryAustin
Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about the picnic.	Becky
Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?	MaryAustin
My ma's going to let me have one.	Becky
Oh, goody; I hope she'll let _me_ come.	MaryAustin
Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I want, and I want you.	Becky
That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?	MaryAustin
By and by. Maybe about vacation.	Becky
Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?	MaryAustin
Yes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be	Becky
Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!	Becky
Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!	Polly
Auntie, what have I done?	Tom
Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don't know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word.	Polly
Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think.	Tom
Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow.	Polly
Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night.	Tom
What did you come for, then?	Polly
It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got drownded.	Tom
Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did--and I know it, Tom.	Polly
Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't.	Tom
Oh, Tom, don't lie--don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times worse.	Polly
It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from grieving--that was all that made me come.	Tom
I'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?	Polly
Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.	Tom
What bark?	Polly
The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now, you'd waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.	Tom
_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?	Polly
Why, yes, I did.	Tom
Are you sure you did, Tom?	Polly
Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.	Tom
What did you kiss me for, Tom?	Polly
Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.	Tom
Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don't bother me any more.	Polly
No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it--but it's a blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope the Lord--I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a lie. I won't look.	Polly
I could forgive the boy, now, if he'd committed a million sins!	Polly
I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won't you?	Tom
I'll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll never speak to you again.	Becky
Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person and look at what they're looking at.	Becky
How could I know you was looking at anything?	Tom
_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen. You just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!	Becky
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school.	Becky
What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school! Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl--they're so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way he always does--ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always tell on them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way out of it."" Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: ""All right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it out!	Tom
Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?	Schoolmaster
Joseph Harper, did you?	Schoolmaster
Gracie Miller?	Schoolmaster
Susan Harper, did you do this?	Schoolmaster
Rebecca Thatcher did you tear--no, look me in the face--did you tear this book?	Schoolmaster
I done it!	Tom
Tom, how _could_ you be so noble!	Becky
Huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?	Tom
'Bout what?	Huck
You know what.	Tom
Oh--'course I haven't.	Huck
Never a word?	Tom
Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?	Huck
Well, I was afeard.	Tom
Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out. _You_ know that.	Huck
Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?	Tom
Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell. They ain't no different way.	Huck
Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer.	Tom
I'm agreed.	Huck
What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it.	Tom
Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the	Huck
time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers.	Huck That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner. Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?	Tom Most always--most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to get drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do that--leastways most of us--preachers and such like. But he's kind of good--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two; and lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.	Huck
Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line. I wish we could get him out of there.	Tom
My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any good; they'd ketch him again.	Huck
Yes--so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done--that.	Tom
I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.	Huck
Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he was to get free they'd lynch him.	Tom
And they'd do it, too.	Huck
You've been mighty good to me, boys--better'n anybody else in this town. And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I, 'I used to mend all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the good fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've all forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck don't--_they_ don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well, boys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that's the only way I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it's right. Right, and _best_, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway. Well, we won't talk about that. I don't want to make _you_ feel bad; you've befriended me. But what I want to say, is, don't _you_ ever get drunk--then you won't ever get here. Stand a litter furder west--so--that's it; it's a prime comfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. Good friendly faces--good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me touch 'em. That's it. Shake hands--yourn'll come through the bars, but mine's too big. Little hands, and weak--but they've helped Muff Potter a power, and they'd help him more if they could.	Potter
Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea. Call Thomas Sawyer!	PotterLawyer
Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the hour of midnight?	PotterLawyer
In the graveyard!	Tom
A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were--	PotterLawyer
In the graveyard.	Tom
Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?	PotterLawyer
Yes, sir.	Tom
Speak up--just a trifle louder. How near were you?	PotterLawyer
Near as I am to you.	Tom
Were you hidden, or not?	PotterLawyer
I was hid.	Tom
Where?	PotterLawyer
Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.	Tom
Any one with you?	PotterLawyer
Yes, sir. I went there with--	Tom
Wait--wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. We will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with you.	PotterLawyer
Speak out, my boy--don't be diffident. The truth is always respectable. What did you take there?	PotterLawyer
Only a--a--dead cat.	Tom
We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us everything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don't skip anything, and don't be afraid.	PotterLawyer
--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun Joe jumped with the knife and--	Tom
Where'll we dig?	Huck
Oh, most anywhere.	Tom
Why, is it hid all around?	Huck
No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.	Tom
Who hides it?	Huck
Why, robbers, of course--who'd you reckon? Sunday-school sup'rintendents?	Tom
I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it and have a good time.	Huck
So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it and leave it there.	Tom
Don't they come after it any more?	Huck
No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks--a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics.	Tom
Hyro--which?	Huck
Hy'roglyphics--pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean anything.	Tom
Have you got one of them papers, Tom?	Huck
No.	Tom
Well then, how you going to find the marks?	Huck
I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or on an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out. Well, we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we can try it again some time; and there's the old ha'nted house up the Still-House branch, and there's lots of dead-limb trees--dead loads of 'em.	Tom
Is it under all of them?	Huck
How you talk! No!	Tom
Then how you going to know which one to go for?	Huck
Go for all of 'em!	Tom
Why, Tom, it'll take all summer.	Huck
Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di'monds. How's that?	Tom
That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred dollars and I don't want no di'monds.	Huck
All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on di'monds. Some of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain't any, hardly, but's worth six bits or a dollar.	Tom
No! Is that so?	Huck
Cert'nly--anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?	Tom
Not as I remember.	Huck
Oh, kings have slathers of them.	Tom
Well, I don' know no kings, Tom.	Huck
I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft of 'em hopping around.	Tom
Do they hop?	Huck
Hop?--your granny! No!	Tom
Well, what did you say they did, for?	Huck
Shucks, I only meant you'd _see_ 'em--not hopping, of course--what do they want to hop for?--but I mean you'd just see 'em--scattered around, you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.	Tom
Richard? What's his other name?	Huck
He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given name.	Tom
No?	Huck
But they don't.	Tom
Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a king and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say--where you going to dig first?	Huck
Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill t'other side of Still-House branch?	Tom
I'm agreed.	Huck
I like this	Tom
So do I.	Huck
Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your share?	Tom
Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go to every circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay time.	Huck
Well, ain't you going to save any of it?	Tom
Save it? What for?	Huck
Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.	Tom
Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell you he'd clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?	Huck
I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure'nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup, and get married.	Tom
Married!	Huck
That's it.	Tom
Tom, you--why, you ain't in your right mind.	Huck
Wait--you'll see.	Tom
Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty well.	Huck
That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight.	Tom
Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you better think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's the name of the gal?	Huck
It ain't a gal at all--it's a girl.	Tom
It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl--both's right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?	Huck
I'll tell you some time--not now.	Tom
All right--that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer than ever.	Huck
No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and we'll go to digging.	Tom
Do they always bury it as deep as this?	Huck
Sometimes--not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got the right place.	Tom
Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?	Huck
I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff Hill back of the widow's.	Tom
I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from us, Tom? It's on her land.	Huck
_She_ take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference whose land it's on.	Tom
Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?	Huck
It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now.	Tom
Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime.	Huck
Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where you dig!	Tom
Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful long way. Can you get out?	Huck
I bet I will. We've got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it.	Tom
Well, I'll come around and maow tonight.	Huck
All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes.	Tom
It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again.	Tom
Well, but we _can't_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.	Huck
I know it, but then there's another thing.	Tom
What's that?	Huck
Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too early.	Tom
That's it, That's the very trouble. We got to give this one up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing's too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's behind me all the time; and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.	Huck
Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.	Tom
Lordy!	Huck
Yes, they do. I've always heard that.	Tom
Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure.	Huck
I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something!	Tom
Don't Tom! It's awful.	Huck
Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit.	Tom
Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else.	Huck
All right, I reckon we better.	Tom
What'll it be?	Huck
The ha'nted house. That's it!	Tom
Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom--nobody could.	Huck
Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't hender us from digging there in the daytime.	Tom
Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that ha'nted house in the day nor the night.	Huck
Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been murdered, anyway--but nothing's ever been seen around that house except in the night--just some blue lights slipping by the windows--no regular ghosts.	Tom
Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em.	Huck
Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so what's the use of our being afeard?	Tom
Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so--but I reckon it's taking chances.	Huck
Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?	Huck
My! I never once thought of it, Huck!	Tom
Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.	Huck
Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.	Tom
_Might_! Better say we _would_! There's some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain't.	Huck
Any fool knows that. I don't reckon _you_ was the first that found it out, Huck.	Tom
Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had a rotten bad dream last night--dreampt about rats.	Huck
No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?	Tom
No.	Huck
Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?	Tom
No. Who's Robin Hood?	Huck
Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the best. He was a robber.	Tom
Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?	Huck
Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with 'em perfectly square.	Tom
Well, he must 'a' been a brick.	Huck
I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.	Tom
What's a _yew_ bow?	Huck
I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse. But we'll play Robin Hood--it's nobby fun. I'll learn you.	Tom
I'm agreed.	Huck
Sh!	Tom
What is it?	Huck
Sh!... There!... Hear it?	Tom
Yes!... Oh, my! Let's run!	Huck
Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door.	Tom
They've stopped.... No--coming.... Here they are. Don't whisper another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!	Tom
No, I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's dangerous.	Robber
Dangerous!	InjunJoe
Milksop!	InjunJoe
What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing's come of it.	InjunJoe
That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about. 'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't succeed.	Robber
Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody would suspicion us that saw us.	InjunJoe
I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view.	Robber
Look here, lad--you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more, for a look. We'll do that 'dangerous' job after I've spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas! We'll leg it together!	InjunJoe
I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch.	InjunJoe
Now's our chance--come!	Tom
I can't--I'd die if they was to wake.	Huck
Here! _You're_ a watchman, ain't you! All right, though--nothing's happened.	InjunJoe
My! have I been asleep?	Robber
Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we do with what little swag we've got left?	InjunJoe
I don't know--leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's something to carry.	Robber
Well--all right--it won't matter to come here once more.	InjunJoe
No--but I'd say come in the night as we used to do--it's better.	Robber
Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a very good place; we'll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.	InjunJoe
Good idea	Robber
Hello!	InjunJoe
What is it?	Robber
Half-rotten plank--no, it's a box, I believe. Here--bear a hand and we'll see what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole.	InjunJoe
Man, it's money!	InjunJoe
We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--I saw it a minute ago.	Robber
Pard, there's thousands of dollars here	InjunJoe
'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one summer	Robber
I know it, and this looks like it, I should say.	InjunJoe
Now you won't need to do that job.	Robber
You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't robbery altogether--it's _revenge_!	InjunJoe
I'll need your help in it. When it's finished--then Texas. Go home to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.	InjunJoe
Well--if you say so; what'll we do with this--bury it again?	Robber
Yes. _No_! by the great Sachem, no! I'd nearly forgot. That pick had fresh earth on it! What business has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on them? Who brought them here--and where are they gone? Have you heard anybody?--seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed? Not exactly--not exactly. We'll take it to my den.	InjunJoe
Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number One?	Robber
No--Number Two--under the cross. The other place is bad--too common.	InjunJoe
All right. It's nearly dark enough to start.	Robber
Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be upstairs?	InjunJoe
Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up there, let them _stay_ there--who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes--and then let them follow us if they want to. I'm willing. In my opinion, whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something. I'll bet they're running yet.	Robber
Revenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!	Tom
Oh, don't!	Huck
Hello, Huck!	Tom
Hello, yourself.	Huck
Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd 'a' got the money. Oh, ain't it awful!	Huck
'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was. Dog'd if I don't, Huck.	Tom
What ain't a dream?	Huck
Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.	Tom
Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream it was! I've had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through 'em--rot him!	Huck
No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!	Tom
Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance for such a pile--and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him, anyway.	Huck
Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to his Number Two.	Tom
Number Two--yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?	Huck
I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck--maybe it's the number of a house!	Tom
Goody!... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here.	Huck
Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here--it's the number of a room--in a tavern, you know!	Tom
Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out quick.	Huck
You stay here, Huck, till I come.	Tom
That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're after.	Tom
I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?	Huck
Lemme think.	Tom
I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go there and try 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to that No. 2, that ain't the place.	Tom
Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!	Huck
Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you--and if he did, maybe he'd never think anything.	Tom
Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono--I dono. I'll try.	Huck
You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a' found out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money.	Tom
It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!	Huck
Now you're _talking_! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't.	Tom
Run! Run, for your life!	Tom
Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either. Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn't locked! I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, _Great Caesar's Ghost!_	Tom
What!--what'd you see, Tom?	Huck
Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!	Tom
No!	Huck
Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.	Tom
Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?	Huck
No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and started!	Tom
I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!	Huck
Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.	Tom
Say, Tom, did you see that box?	Huck
Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?	Tom
How?	Huck
Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?	Tom
Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's drunk.	Huck
It is, that! You try it!	Tom
Well, no--I reckon not.	Huck
And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.	Tom
Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job.	Huck
All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow--and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that'll fetch me.	Tom
Agreed, and good as wheat!	Huck
Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?	Tom
I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.	Huck
That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?	Tom
In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat _with_ him. But you needn't tell that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he wouldn't want to do as a steady thing.	Huck
Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night, just skip right around and maow.	Tom
You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.	MrsThatcher
Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.	Becky
Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.	MrsThatcher
Say--I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll have ice-cream! She has it most every day--dead loads of it. And she'll be awful glad to have us.	Tom
Oh, that will be fun!	Becky
But what will mamma say?	Becky
How'll she ever know?	Tom
I reckon it's wrong--but--	Becky
But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!	Tom
Damn her, maybe she's got company--there's lights, late as it is.	InjunJoe
I can't see any.	Robber
Because the bush is in your way. Now--this way--now you see, don't you?	Huck
Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.	Robber
Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told you before, I don't care for her swag--you may have it. But her husband was rough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't a millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!--horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on! _Horsewhipped_!--do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But I'll take it out of _her_.	InjunJoe
Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!	Robber
Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't kill her--bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils--you notch her ears like a sow!	InjunJoe
By God, that's--	Robber
Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll not cry, if she does. My friend, you'll help me in this thing--for _my_ sake--that's why you're here--I mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll kill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill her--and then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this business.	InjunJoe
Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the better--I'm all in a shiver.	Robber
Do it _now_? And company there? Look here--I'll get suspicious of you, first thing you know. No--we'll wait till the lights are out--there's no hurry.	InjunJoe
What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?	Jones
Let me in--quick! I'll tell everything.	Huck
Why, who are you?	Jones
Huckleberry Finn--quick, let me in!	Huck
Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge! But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble.	Jones
Please don't ever tell I told you. Please don't--I'd be killed, sure--but the widow's been good friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell--I _will_ tell if you'll promise you won't ever say it was me.	Huck
By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!	Jones
Who's there!	Jones
Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!	Huck
It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome!	Jones
Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too--make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here last night.	Jones
I was awful scared, and I run. I took out when the pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.	Huck
Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it--but there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they ain't dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar that sumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use--'twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals--'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?	Jones
Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.	Huck
Splendid! Describe them--describe them, my boy!	Jones
One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged--	Huck
That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell the sheriff--get your breakfast tomorrow morning!	Jones
Oh, please don't tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh, please!	Huck
All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did.	Welshsons
Oh no, no! Please don't tell!	Huck
They won't tell--and I won't. But why don't you want it known?	Jones
How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking suspicious?	Jones
Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so, and I don't see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I come along upstreet 'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil.	Huck
Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?	Jones
Well, I don't know--but somehow it seems as if I did.	Huck
Then they went on, and you--	Jones
Follered 'em--yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up--they sneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just as I told you and your two--	Huck
What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!	Jones
My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for all the world. No--I'd protect you--I'd protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me--I won't betray you.	Jones
'Tain't a Spaniard--it's Injun Joe!	Huck
It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter altogether.	Jones
Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the _matter_ with you?	Jones
Sunday-school books, maybe.	Huck
Poor old chap, you're white and jaded--you ain't well a bit--no wonder you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.	Jones
Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but for him.	Jones
I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?	Widow
We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come again--they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They've just come back.	Jones
Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to death.	MrsThatcher
Your Becky?	MrsHarper
Yes, didn't she stay with you last night?	MrsThatcher
Why, no.	MrsHarper
Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night--one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to settle with him.	Polly
He didn't stay with us.	MrsHarper
Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?	Polly
No'm.	JoeHarper
When did you see him last?	Polly
You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands.	Polly
What? What was it?	Huck
Liquor!--and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child--what a turn you did give me!	Widow
Only tell me just one thing--only just one--please! Was it Tom Sawyer that found it?	Huck
Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you before, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!	Widow
There--he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.	Huck
Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others.	Becky
Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don't know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear them here.	Tom
I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back.	Becky
Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better.	Tom
Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me.	Becky
I reckon I could find it--but then the bats. If they put our candles out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go through there.	Tom
Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!	Becky
Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right away!	Tom
Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get worse and worse off all the time.	Becky
Listen!	Tom
Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid	Becky
It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know	Tom
Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!	Becky
Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to come back! No--I can't find the way. It's all mixed up.	Tom
Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful place! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!	Becky
Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again.	Becky
I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find the way out.	Tom
We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I reckon we are going there.	Becky
Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying.	Tom
Tom, I am so hungry!	Becky
Do you remember this?	Tom
It's our wedding-cake, Tom.	Becky
Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got.	Tom
I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup people do with wedding-cake--but it'll be our--	Becky
Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?	Tom
Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink. That little piece is our last candle!	Tom
Tom!	Becky
Well, Becky?	Tom
They'll miss us and hunt for us!	Becky
Yes, they will! Certainly they will!	Tom
Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom.	Becky
Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.	Tom
When would they miss us, Tom?	Becky
When they get back to the boat, I reckon.	Tom
Tom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn't come?	Becky
I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they got home.	Tom
SH! Did you hear that?	Tom
It's them!	Tom
they're coming! Come along, Becky--we're all right now!	Tom
Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt. But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any more.	JudgeThatcher
Why?	Tom
Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and triple-locked--and I've got the keys.	JudgeThatcher
What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!	JudgeThatcher
Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?	JudgeThatcher
Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!	Tom
I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something's always told me we'd never get holt of that swag.	Huck
Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you was to watch there that night?	Tom
Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder's.	Huck
_You_ followed him?	Tom
Yes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him, and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.	Huck
Well, whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways it's a goner for us, Tom.	Huck
Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!	Tom
What!	Huck
Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?	Huck
Huck, it's in the cave!	Tom
Say it again, Tom.	Huck
The money's in the cave!	Tom
Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?	Huck
Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in there with me and help get it out?	Tom
I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost.	Huck
Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world.	Tom
Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's--	Huck
Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will, by jings.	Tom
All right--it's a whiz. When do you say?	Huck
Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?	Tom
Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days, now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could.	Huck
It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck, but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You needn't ever turn your hand over.	Tom
Less start right off, Tom.	Huck
All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I had some when I was in there before.	Tom
Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's one of my marks. We'll get ashore, now.	Tom
Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.	Tom
Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country. You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be a robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to run across it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll keep it quiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course there's got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn't be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang--it sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?	Tom
Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?	Huck
Oh, most anybody. Waylay people--that's mostly the way.	Tom
And kill them?	Huck
No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.	Tom
What's a ransom?	Huck
Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the women, but you don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers--you'll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books.	Tom
Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.	Huck
Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all that.	Tom
Now I'll show you something, Huck.	Tom
Tom, it's a _cross_!	Huck
_Now_ where's your Number Two? '_under the cross_,' hey? Right yonder's where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!	Tom
Tom, less git out of here!	Huck
What! and leave the treasure?	Tom
Yes--leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain.	Huck
No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he died--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.	Tom
No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of ghosts, and so do you.	Huck
Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!	Tom
Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.	Huck
He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground.	Tom
Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's that for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I'm going to dig in the clay.	Tom
That ain't no bad notion, Tom!	Huck
Hey, Huck!--you hear that?	Tom
My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!	Tom
Got it at last!	Huck
My, but we're rich, Tom!	Huck
Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but we _have_ got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.	Tom
I thought so. _They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of fetching the little bags along.	Tom
Now less fetch the guns and things	Huck
No, Huck--leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies.	Tom
What orgies?	Huck
I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff.	Tom
Now, Huck, we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be gone a minute.	Tom
Hallo, who's that?	Jones
Huck and Tom Sawyer.	TomHuck
Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here--hurry up, trot ahead--I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?	Jones
Old metal	Tom
I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's human nature--hurry along, hurry along!	Jones
Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'.	Jones
Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing.	Huck
Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you and the widow good friends?	Jones
Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway.	Huck
All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?	Jones
Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.	Jones
And you did just right. Come with me, boys.	Widow
Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes--shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's--no, no thanks, Huck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both of you. Get into them. We'll wait--come down when you are slicked up enough.	Widow
Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain't high from the ground.	Huck
Shucks! what do you want to slope for?	Tom
Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't going down there, Tom.	Huck
Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care of you.	Tom
Tom, auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about you. Say--ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?	Sidney
Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this blowout about, anyway?	Tom
It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something, if you want to know.	Sidney
Well, what?	Tom
Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a secret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now. Everybody knows--the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here--couldn't get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know!	Sidney
Secret about what, Sid?	Tom
About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop pretty flat.	Sidney
Sid, was it you that told?	Tom
Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told--that's enough.	Sidney
Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and that's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean things, and you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones. There--no thanks, as the widow says. Now go and tell auntie if you dare--and tomorrow you'll catch it!	Tom
Huck don't need it. Huck's rich.	Tom
Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it. Oh, you needn't smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.	Tom
Sid, what ails Tom?	Polly
He--well, there ain't ever any making of that boy out. I never--	Polly
There--what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!	Tom
I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm willing to allow.	Jones
Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to me, and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up just at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air git through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a cellar-door for--well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in there, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything's so awful reg'lar a body can't stand it.	Huck
Well, everybody does that way, Huck.	Tom
Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't _stand_ it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy--I don't take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in a-swimming--dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do everything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort--I'd got to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke; she wouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor scratch, before folks--"" [Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury]--""And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a woman! I _had_ to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school's going to open, and I'd a had to go to it--well, I wouldn't stand _that_, Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits me, and I ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into all this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you just take my sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not many times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable hard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.	Huck
Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if you'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.	Tom
Like it! Yes--the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long enough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and I'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd got guns, and a cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all!	Huck
Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning robber.	Tom
No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?	Huck
Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know.	Tom
Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?	Huck
Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a pirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up in the nobility--dukes and such.	Tom
Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?	Huck
Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I _don't_ want to--but what would people say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't.	Tom
Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom.	Huck
All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck.	Tom
Will you, Tom--now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?	Huck
Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation tonight, maybe.	Tom
Have the which?	Huck
Have the initiation.	Tom
What's that?	Huck
It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang.	Tom
That's gay--that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.	Huck
Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha'nted house is the best, but they're all ripped up now.	Tom
Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom.	Huck
Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with blood.	Tom
Now, that's something _like_! Why, it's a million times bullier than pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.	Huck
