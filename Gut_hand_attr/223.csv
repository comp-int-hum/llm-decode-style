Dey calls me Jimmy, Sah, but my right name's James, Sah.	Jimmy
No, sah, -- not zackly. I was kind o' sick den. But de res' o' de people dey had a good time -- mos' all uv 'em had a good time. Dey all got drunk. Dey all gits drunk heah, every Christmas, and carries on and has awful good times.	Jimmy
Oh, no, Sah -- I don' never git drunk -- it's de white folks -- dem's de ones I means. Pa used to git drunk, but dat was befo' I was big -- but he's done quit. He don' git drunk no mo' now. Jis' takes one nip in de mawnin', now, cuz his stomach riles up, he sleeps so soun'. Jis' one nip -- over to de s'loon -- every mawnin'.  He's powerful sickly -- powerful -- sometimes he can't hardly git aroun', he can't. He goes to de doctor every week -- over to Ragtown. An' one time he tuck some stuff, you know, an' it mighty near fetched him. Ain't it dish-yer blue-vittles dat's pison? -- ain't dat it? -- truck what you pisons cats wid?	Jimmy
Well, den, dat was it. De ole man, he tuck de bottle and shuck it, and shuck it -- he seed it was blue, and he didn't know but it was 'spected maybe dish-yer truck might be some other kin' o' blue stuff, and so he sot de bottle down, and drat if it wa'n't blue vittles, sho' nuff, when de doctor come. An' de doctor he say if he'd a tuck dat blue vittles it would a highsted him, sho'. People can't be too particular 'bout sich things. Yes indeedy!	Jimmy
We ain't got no cats heah, 'bout dis hotel. Bill he don't like 'em. He can't stan' a cat no way. Ef he was to ketch one he'd slam it outen de winder in a minute. Yes he would. Bill's down on cats. So is de gals -- waiter gals. When dey ketches a cat bummin' aroun' heah, dey jis' scoops him -- 'deed they do. Dey snake him into de cistern -- dey's been cats drownded in dat water dat's in yo' pitcher. I seed a cat in dare yistiddy -- all swelled up like a pudd'n. I bet you dem gals done dat. Ma says if dey was to drownd a cat for her, de fust one of 'em she ketched she'd jam her into de cistern 'long wid de cat. Ma wouldn't do dat, I don't reckon, but 'deed an' double, she said she would. I can't kill a chicken -- well I kin wring its neck off, cuz dat don't make 'em no sufferin scacely; but I can't take and chop dey heads off, like some people kin. It makes me feel so -- so -- well, I kin see dat chicken nights so's I can't sleep. Mr. Dunlap, he's de richest man in dis town. Some people says dey's fo' thousan' people in dis town -- dis city. But Bill he says dey aint but 'bout thirty-three hund'd. And bill he knows, cuz, he's lived heah all his life, do' dey do say he won't never set de river on fire. I don't know how dey fin' out -- I wouldn't like to count all dem people. Some folks say dis town would be considerable bigger if it wa'n't on accounts of so much lan' all roun' it dat ain't got no houses on it.	Jimmy
I reckon you seed dat church as you come along up street. Dat's an awful big church -- awful high steeple. An' it's all solid stone, excep' jes' de top part -- de steeple, I means -- dat's wood. It falls off when de win' blows pooty hard, an' one time it stuck in a cow's back and busted de cow all to de mischief. It's gwine to kill some body yit, dat steeple is. A man -- big man, he was -- bigger'n what Bill is -- he tuck it up dare and fixed it again -- an' he didn't look no bigger'n a boy, he was so high up. Dat steeple's awful high. If you look out de winder you kin see it.	Jimmy
You see dat dis do'.	Jimmy
I seed it when dy pulled it outen de cow. It mus' be Booms and jars so's you think the world's a comin' to an end. I wouldn't like to be up dare when de clock's a strikin'. Dat clock ain't and it's a buster. You kin hear dat bell all over dis city. You ought to hear it boom, boom, boom when dey's a fire. My sakes! Dey ain't got no bell like dat in Ragtown. I ben to Ragtown, an' I ben mos' halfway to Dockery. De bell in Ragtown's got so ole now she don't make no soun', scasely.	Jimmy
Bill, didn't you say dat dey was only thirty-three hund'd people in dis city?	Jimmy
Well, some folks say dey's fo' thousan'.	Jimmy
Bill, I don't think dis gen'lman kin eat a whole prairie-chicken, but dey tole me to fetch it all up.	Jimmy
Bill he's de oldest. An' he's de bes', too. Dey's fo'teen in dis fam'ly -- all boys an' gals. Bill he suppo'ts em all -- an' he don' never complain -- he's real good, Bill is. All dem brothers an' sisters o' his'n ain't no 'count -- all ceptin' dat little teeny one dat fetched in dat milk. Dat's Kit, Sah. She ain't only nine year ole. But she's do mos' lady-like one in de whole bilin'. You don't never see Kit a-rairin' an' a-chargin' aroun' an' kickin' up her heels like de res' o' de gals in dis fam'ly does gen'ally. Dat was Nan dat you hearn a-cuttin' dem shines on de pi-anah while ago. An' sometimes ef she don't rastle dat pianah when she gits started! Tab can't hole a candle to her, but Tab kin sing like de very nation. She's de only one in dis family dat kin sing. You don't never hear a yelp outen Nan. Nan can't sing for shucks. I'd jes' lieves hear a tom-cat dat's got scalded. Dey's fo'-teen in dis fam'ly 'sides de ole man an' de ole 'ooman -- all brothers an' sisters. But some of 'em don't live heah -- do' Bill he suppo'ts 'em -- lends 'em money an' pays dey debts an' he'ps 'em along. I tell you Bill he's real good. Dey all gits drunk -- all 'cep Bill. De ole man he gits drunk, too, same as de res' uv 'em. Bob, he don't git drunk much -- jes' sloshes roun' de s'loons some, an' takes a dram sometimes. Bob he's next to Bill -- 'bout forty year old. Dey's all married -- all de fam'ly's married -- cep' some of de gals. Dare's fo'teen. It's de biggest family in dese parts, dey say. Dare's Bill -- Bill Nubbles -- Nubbles is de name; Bill an' Griz, an' Duke, an' Bob, an' Nan, an' Tab, an' Kit, an' Sol, an' Si, an' Phil, an' Jake, an' Sal -- Sal she's married an' got chil'en as big as I is -- an' Hoss Nubbles, he's de las'. Hoss is what dey mos' always calls him, but he's got another name dat I somehow disremember, it's so kind o' hard to git de hand of it.	Jimmy
But in de mawnin' I can ask Bill what's Hoss's other name, an' den I'll come up an' tell you when I fetches yo' breakfast. An' may be I done got some o' dem names mixed up, but Bill, he kin tell me. Dey's fo'teen.	Jimmy
Dad-fetch it, somehow dat other name don't come. But anyways, you jes' read dem names over an' see if dey's fo'teen.	Jimmy
Dat's right, Sah. Dey's all down, I'll fetch up Hoss's other name in de mawnin', Sah. Don't you be oneasy.	Jimmy
